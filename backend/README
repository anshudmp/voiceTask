1. Introduction
Node.js is a powerful runtime environment for building server-side applications using JavaScript. Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, which simplifies working with MongoDB by providing a more structured and efficient way to interact with your data.

This README will guide you through setting up a Node.js project and using Mongoose to work with MongoDB databases.

2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js: Node.js is required to run your Node.js application.
npm: Node Package Manager, usually included with Node.js.
MongoDB: A running MongoDB server or access to a remote MongoDB instance.

3.Getting Started
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory using the command line:
cd voiceTask/backend

Install the project dependencies using npm:
npm install

Create a .env file in the project root directory and configure your MongoDB connection URI. For example:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost/your-database-name

Run the Node.js application:
npm start
